# 📂 File Handling in C++ – Tanzeela Fatima

This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in **C++**, including:

- Creating and writing to files
- Reading from files
- Appending to existing files
- Copying contents between files

## 📁 Files Used

| File Name        | Purpose                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Tanzeela.txt`   | Created and written with sample text            |
| `Tanzeela1.txt`  | Opened in append mode and modified              |
| `Tanzeela2.txt`  | Destination file for copying content            |

## 🧪 Operations Performed

### ✅ Write
- Opens `Tanzeela.txt` in output mode.
- Writes multiple lines to it and closes the file.

### ✅ Read
- Opens `Tanzeela.txt` in input mode.
- Reads and prints each line to the console.

### ✅ Append
- Opens `Tanzeela1.txt` in append mode.
- Appends a single line to preserve existing content.

### ✅ Copy
- Reads from `Tanzeela.txt` and writes the same content into `Tanzeela2.txt`.

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

### 🔧 Compile:
```bash
g++ file_handling.cpp -o file_handling
````

### ▶️ Run:

```bash
./file_handling
```

After running, check your folder for:

* `Tanzeela.txt` (newly written file)
* `Tanzeela1.txt` (with an appended line)
* `Tanzeela2.txt` (a copy of `Tanzeela.txt`)
